<p>


* create a new repository by clicking on the __Use this template__ button above
* name your repository using this convention:
   * `creatorname_year_keyword` (e.g. `corcho_2022_collision`)
* populate this markdown document (`Readme.md`) with as much information as you can
* information is recorded in 3 recurring structures:
    * **Metadata Fields** (markdown tables)
    * **Metadata Tags** (markdown checkboxes)
    * **File Description** (markdown tables)
* you need to physically edit the markdown (plain text). You can do this directly through github, or on your device with a plain text editor.
    * Many of the fields have place holder / example text to help guide you. Delete this text and replace with your own.   
* add any files to the `model_files` and `web_files` subfolders.
* once you have completed these steps, you can submit your model back to M@TE <https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth>

**Title** |The Role of Lithospheric-Deep Mantle Interactions on the Style and Stress Evolution of Arc-Continent Collision | ...
**Abstract** | Continents grow by the successive accretion of material to their margins, mostly collision and accretion of intra-oceanic magmatic arcs. We investigate the effect of arc buoyancy and viscosity on the mode of collision, and the effects on the margin using a computer modeling approach. Our simulations show that upon collision, it is a small differential in density (3%) between the colliding arc and the continental margin that dictates whether subduction continues or stops after collision. In addition, our models show that arc buoyancy and viscosity drive lithospheric extension in the continental plate. Also, as the subducting slab reaches a mantle discontinuity at 660 km depth, it folds and causes strain and stress fluctuations on the margin.|

**Summary of dataset** | This dataset includes 2 end-member models from the larger suite of models described in Corcho et al., 2022. The models simulate arc-continent collision in a two-dimensional box, 3,600 km long and 800 km deep. The 2 end-member models have arc terranes with 25 km and 35 km thick crust respectively.   The models were developed using the particle-in-cell, finite element code Underworld2/UWGeodynamics version 2.9.6 (Beucher et al., 2019; Mansour et al., 2020). See associated publication for further implementation details and reference. The data are stored in HDF files with .xdmf/.xml files enabling a mapping between HDF arrays and VTK data structures. The .xdmf/.xml can be read into Paraview (tested with version 5.8.0, using the "XDMF Reader"), as well as the Python vtk library and associated packages such as Pyvista. The README.md file provides more information on the dataset and files. The dataset may be useful for further research as well as education purposes.|

> **Note**
> To feature your model on our website (<https://mate.science>), we will require some images/animations and captions. Please add files to the `web_files` folder, and describe these files using the following **File Description** Table. The **Purpose** field will be used to help direct the content. You do not need to supply all of these, and you may supply multiple files with the same purpose.

**File Description**

File | Purpose | Caption
--- | --- | ---
`landing_image.png` | landing page image |  Example of the temporal evolution of the numerical simulations that result in failed arc transference and slab break-off (more buoyant remnant arcs) with an
effective thickness between 32 and 35 km.
`graphic_abstract.png` | visual abstract |  Schematic illustration of initial model conditions and subsequent post-collisional evolution of the two identified styles of arc-continent collision, whose dynamics are controlled by arc transference and slab-anchoring in less buoyant remnant arcs (see publication for further detail)
`model_setup.jpg` | model setup | (a) Model set up for numerical simulations based on previous research in the dynamics of accretionary continental margins (Moresi et al., 2014). It includes an oceanic subducting plate (dark yellow), an overriding plate composed by a continental (cyan) and cratonic domain (dark blue), and a ribbon of thicker crust representing a remnant = intra-oceanic arc attached to the oceanic plate (red). The upper mantle and the upper-lower mantle boundary are included to capture deep-mantle slab interactions. Orange, yellow, and dark green dots show locations where subducting plate convergence velocity, the trench-retreat velocity and the overriding plate (OP) retreat velocity were measured. The (b–e) profiles show a schematic lithospheric cross-section of the domains considered in our model set-up (see publication for further detail).
